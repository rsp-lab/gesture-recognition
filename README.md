![Gesture Recognition Image](/gesture-recognition.png?raw=false)

This application, developed as a student project, is designed to recognize simple human hand gestures and movements. The results of this recognition are intended to control a computer by triggering predefined keyboard shortcuts for selected applications.

The total number of defined gestures is 12 and includes:
1. Showing a certain number of fingers: one, two, three, or more fingers
2. Hand movement: left, right, up, down

It utilizes a simple Haar classifier to detect fingers and capture skin samples.
